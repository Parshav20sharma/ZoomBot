# ZOOM BOT

**ZOOM BOT** is a Python-based automation tool designed to streamline the process of joining Zoom meetings and managing meeting controls. The bot allows users to automatically join meetings, turn on the camera, take screenshots, start/pause/stop recordings, and leave meetings based on the options selected via checkboxes in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Automatic Meeting Join**: Automatically joins the Zoom meeting with the provided details.
- **Camera Control**: Option to turn on the camera when joining the meeting.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Automatically takes a screenshot during the meeting.
- **Recording Management**: Automatically start, pause, and stop recording the meeting.
- **Leave Meeting**: Automatically leaves the meeting after the tasks are completed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for the UI)
- PyAutoGUI (for automation)
- OpenCV (for image recognition)
- PyInstaller (for bundling the app)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zoom-bot.git
   cd zoom-bot
   ```

2. **Install the Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python zoom_bot.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the ZOOM BOT**: Run the application by executing the `zoom_bot.py` file.
2. **Input Details**: Enter your meeting ID, passcode, and personal details into the UI.
3. **Select Options**: Check the checkboxes for the actions you want the bot to perform (e.g., turn on camera, start recording).
4. **Start the Bot**: Click on the "Start" button to execute the bot. The bot will perform the selected tasks automatically.
5. **Executable**: If you prefer, you can create a standalone executable using PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "images;images" zoom_bot.py
   ```

## Images Used for Automation

The bot uses the following images for automation tasks:
- `checkbox1.png`
- `checkbox2.png`
- `join_button.png`
- `join_meeting_button.png`
- `send_request.png`

Ensure these images are in the correct directory or bundled with the executable.
